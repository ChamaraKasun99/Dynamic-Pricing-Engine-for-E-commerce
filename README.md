# Dynamic-Pricing-Engine-for-E-commerce
Build a machine learning model that changes product prices in real-time based on demand, seasonality, competitor pricing, and supply chain constraints.

Core Components
User Inputs: Real-time product data and constraints.
Feature Engineering: Extract time-based trends, competitor price index, demand levels.
Forecasting Module: Predict demand using Time Series or ML.
Elasticity Estimation: Price elasticity of demand.
Optimization Engine: Compute ideal price using constraints and predicted outputs.
Dashboard Output: Price recommendation and expected revenue.

Assumptions
Competitor prices, supply data, and demand signals are accessible.
Seasonality is derived from historical sales and calendar data.
Price elasticity can be modeled or estimated from data.
Objective is maximizing revenue or profit margin.
